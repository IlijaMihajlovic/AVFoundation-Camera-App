A camera app with a launch/splash screen and multiple functions each of which is a button, with added animation showing the strength and complexity of AVFoundation. This camera app can record videos, take pictures, switch cameras front and back also turn the flash on and off.

## Side Note
* Currently, I do not have an iPhone, so I'm unable to test the app on a physical device. I apologize in advance for maybe possible bugs.

   Kind regards,
